Project Title: Regression Analysis to Uncover Bike Usage Trends

Overview

This project employs advanced statistical modeling to analyze patterns in bike-sharing usage, providing actionable insights into customer behavior and operational efficiency. Using the Bike Sharing Dataset, the analysis identifies key drivers of bike rentals, including weather conditions, seasonality, and time-of-day trends, enabling businesses to optimize their services and enhance customer satisfaction.

Business Insights

Seasonal Demand: Bike usage peaks in summer and winter, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing and resource allocation during these seasons.

Impact of Weather: Misty conditions positively influence bike rentals, while light rain and high humidity suppress usage, offering guidance for dynamic pricing strategies.
  
Operational Optimization: Weekdays and non-holidays see higher usage, indicating that bike availability and maintenance schedules should align with peak demand times.

Technical Skills and Tools

Programming Language: R

Libraries: ggplot2 (visualization), dplyr (data manipulation), moments (statistical measures)

Statistical Methods: Simple and multiple linear regression, skewness and kurtosis analysis, and measures of central tendency and dispersion.

Visualization: Histograms, box plots, and bar charts to explore data distribution and highlight trends.
Applications

Customer Insights: Predict customer demand and segment user behavior based on environmental and temporal factors.

Resource Allocation: Optimize bike inventory and maintenance scheduling to reduce downtime and meet demand.

Pricing Strategies: Implement dynamic pricing based on weather and seasonal conditions to maximize profitability.

Conclusion
By integrating regression analysis with business operations, this project demonstrates how data-driven decisions can improve service delivery and operational efficiency in bike-sharing systems. The methodology and insights can extend to other shared mobility platforms, enabling scalable and customer-centric strategies.
